# CLAUDE_RULES_START

# DEFAULT DEVELOPMENT RULES

**Version:** 20260320 V1
**Description:** Agent behavior contract distributed to all AI agent projects — covers git, error handling, and completion standards

Full specification and methodology: `Specifications/AGENTS.md` in the Specifications repository. This condensed version covers agent behavior only.

---

## Git Workflow

1. Commit immediately after completing a task with no errors.
2. Commit messages: descriptive text, no "Claude"/"Anthropic"/"AI" mentions.
3. DO NOT push — local commits only.
4. NO co-authored-by lines.

Web server changes: print "No restart needed — browser refresh is enough." (templates/CSS/static only) or "Restart required — `./bin/start.sh`." (Python/JS server files).

## Project Layout

```
ProjectName/
  METADATA.md       Identity (name, port, status, stack, etc.)
  AGENTS.md         AI context: dev commands, endpoints, architecture
  CLAUDE.md         Contains only: @AGENTS.md
  .env.sample       Required env vars (committed)
  .env              Actual env vars (never committed)
  bin/              All executable scripts
    common.sh       Shared functions — sourced by all bash scripts
    common.py       Shared OperationContext — imported by Python scripts
  doc/              Generated documentation
  logs/             Log files (gitignored)
  data/             Persistent data
  tests/            Test suite
```

---

## Scripts (`bin/`)

All scripts live in `bin/` — bash (`.sh`) or Python (`.py`). The `# CommandCenter Operation` marker in the first 20 lines registers a script with the platform.

**Standard script names** (only create what the project needs):

| Script | Purpose | Name String
|--------|---------|
| `bin/start.sh` | Start service — service projects only | Stop Service |
| `bin/stop.sh` | Stop service — service projects only | Stop Service |
| `bin/build.sh` | Build / compile / package | Build |
| `bin/daily.sh` | Daily maintenance | Daily Batch |
| `bin/weekly.sh` | Weekly maintenance | Weekly Batch |
| `bin/build_documentation.sh` | Generate doc/ output | Build Doc |
| `bin/deploy.sh` | Deploy to environment | Deploy |

If the script name matches a Standard Script Name the following header should exist with a Name: field matching the Name String.  If possible
these should be the first lines of the file and there should be no other "# Name:" or "# Category:" fields.

#!/bin/bash
# CommandCenter Operation
# Name: {Name String}
# Category: Operations

**Bash** — source `common.sh` then add functionality:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# CommandCenter Operation
# Category: service
source "$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)/common.sh"

# your start command — use $PORT for the service port
# e.g. Flask: export FLASK_DEBUG=1 && flask run --port "$PORT"
```

`common.sh` handles everything: `SCRIPT_NAME`, `PROJECT_DIR`, `cd`, `PROJECT_NAME`, `PORT`, venv activation, `.secrets`/`.env` loading, timestamped log file, SIGTERM trap, and the `[$PROJECT_NAME] Starting:` message. Use `$PORT` as the service port — never hardcode a port number. Override the trap after sourcing if the script needs custom cleanup.

**Python** — import `common.py` then add functionality:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# CommandCenter Operation
# Category: maintenance
import sys, os; sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__)); from common import op

def main(ctx):
    # ctx.project_name, ctx.port, ctx.logger available — use ctx.port as the service port
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    op(__file__).run(main)
```

`op(__file__).run(main)` handles the same concerns as `common.sh`: path setup, METADATA.md parsing, env loading, logging, SIGTERM, and status messages.

Use Linux line endings (no `\r`). Run `chmod +x bin/*.sh`.

## METADATA.md

**Authoritative source for project identity.** Always read `name`, `display_name`, `short_description`, and `git_repo` from this file — never infer them from directory names. Present in every set-up project.

Key-value format (not YAML):

```
# AUTHORITATIVE PROJECT METADATA - THE FIELDS IN THIS FILE SHOULD BE CURRENT

name: MyProject                              # machine slug, matches directory name
display_name: My Project                     # human-readable name for UI/display
git_repo: https://github.com/org/MyProject   # full HTTPS URL, for links only
port: 8000                                   # omit if not a service
short_description: One sentence.             # shown in dashboards and indexes
health: /health                              # omit if not a service
status: PROTOTYPE                            # IDEA|PROTOTYPE|ACTIVE|PRODUCTION|ARCHIVED
stack: Python/Flask/SQLite                   # slash-separated, used by generate_prompt.sh
version: 2026-03-16.1                        # YYYY-MM-DD.N, increment on releases
updated: 20260316_120000                     # set automatically by platform scripts
```

`port`, `health`, `stack`, and `status` are platform fields — managed by GAME and platform scripts, not needed for day-to-day agent work. `git_repo` SSH remotes are normalised to HTTPS automatically.
